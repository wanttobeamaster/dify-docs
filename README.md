# 📘 Dify Documentation (Migrating)

> **This documentation project is currently being migrated to a new repository.**

We are in the process of moving the `dify-docs` project to a new structure powered by Mintlify for better maintainability and collaboration.

- 🆕 **New Repository (in progress)**: [https://github.com/Landahans/dify-docs-mintlify](https://github.com/Landahans/dify-docs-mintlify)  
  > Don't worry — this is just a **temporary repository** for migration and testing purposes.  
  > Once the migration is complete, all content will be **merged back to the original `dify-docs` repository**, and this temporary repository will be archived.
- 🌐 **New Documentation Site (temporary)**: [https://docs.dify.dev/en/introduction](https://docs.dify.dev/en/introduction)  
  > This is a temporary domain. Once the migration is complete and fully tested, the official documentation will be available at **[https://docs.dify.ai](https://docs.dify.ai)**.

## 🚧 Migration Notice

During this transition period:

- We will continue reviewing and merging **existing open PRs** in this repository.
- **Please avoid submitting new PRs here** unless necessary.
- For **new contributions**, especially non-urgent ones, please head over to the new repo: [dify-docs-mintlify](https://github.com/Landahans/dify-docs-mintlify).
- Contributions to the new repository are highly appreciated — we welcome help with proofreading, editing, and content improvements.

Once the migration is successfully completed, this repository may be archived or switched to read-only.
