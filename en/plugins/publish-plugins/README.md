# Publish Plugins

### Publish Methods

To accommodate the various publishing needs of developers, Dify provides three plugin publish methods:

#### **1. Marketplace**

**Introduction**: The official Dify plugin marketplace allows users to browse, search, and install a variety of plugins with just one click.

**Features**:

* Plugins become available after passing a review, ensuring they are **trustworthy** and **high-quality**.
* Can be installed directly into an individual or team **Workspaces**.

**Publication Process**:

* Submit the plugin project to the **Dify Marketplace** [code repository](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugins).
* After an official review, the plugin will be publicly released in the marketplace for other users to install and use.

For detailed instructions, please refer to:

## Third-Party Signature Verification

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature is only available in the Dify Community Edition. Third-party signature verification is not supported in Dify Cloud Edition at this time.
{% endhint %}

With third-party signature verification, Dify administrators can safely permit the installation of plugins not listed on the Dify Marketplace without completely disabling signature validation.

Dify administrators can add signatures to verified plugins using pre-approved private keys. In addition, Dify can be configured to verify plugins using pre-approved public keys during installation.
